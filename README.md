## Computer-Graphics-Project 

This is a beginner computer graphics project with three cool scenes:

**1st Scenario**: A city hub with trains, ships, and cars amidst tall buildings, parks, and a flowing river.  
**2nd Scenario**: A peaceful riverside village with huts, boats, and hills surrounded by trees, clouds, and the sun.  
**3rd Scenario**: A snowy hillside where people skate on frozen roads, build snowmen, and enjoy cable car rides amidst snow-covered trees and cars.

### Features:
- You can change the weather:
  - Make it **rain** in the village.
  - Make it **snow** in the snowy place.
- Control the **speeds** and **directions** of buses, metro rail, boats, ships, humans, cars, and cable cars.

It's a fun way to play around with basic computer graphics like humans, cars, cable cars, and weather effects!

I used **CodeBlocks** and **OpenGL**.

**To install CodeBlocks**: [CodeBlocks Downloads](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/)
