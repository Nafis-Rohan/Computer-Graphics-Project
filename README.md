# NafisRohan12-Computer-Graphics-Project
This is a beginner computer graphics project with three cool scenes:

Urban Seaside: A city next to the ocean.
Village: A quiet village.
Snowy Place: A snowy landscape.
Features:
You can change the weather:
Make it rain in the village.
Make it snow in the snowy place.
It's a fun way to play around with basic computer graphics like human, cars , cable cars and weather effects!
