## Computer-Graphics-Project 

This is a beginner computer graphics project with three cool scenes:

**Urban Seaside**: A city next to the ocean.  
**Village**: A quiet village.  
**Snowy Place**: A snowy landscape.

### Features:
- You can change the weather:
  - Make it **rain** in the village.
  - Make it **snow** in the snowy place.

It's a fun way to play around with basic computer graphics like humans, cars, cable cars, and weather effects!

I used **CodeBlocks** and **OpenGL**.

**To install CodeBlocks**: [CodeBlocks Downloads](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/)
